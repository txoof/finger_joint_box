#### Usage:
 ##### tSlotBox(size = [X, Y, Z], material =  N, finger = N, lidFinger = N, layout = "layout tpe", bolt = N, alpha = R);
  * size = [X, Y, Z] - X, Y, Z dimensions in mm
  * material = N - material thickness
  * finger = N - number of fingers
  * lidFinger = N - this should be set to the same value as finger (
  * layout = "layout type" - 2D (for DXF output), 3D (3D model for visualisation, flat - 3D printable flat version
  * bolt = N - length of bolt
  * alpha = R - real between 0 and 1 to adjust the transparency


#### To Do:
  * write each face as separate module (front, back, left, etc.) to make modifications simpler 
  * remove lidFinger
